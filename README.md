# H4X0R

## Overview
H4X0R is a Hacker News reader application built for iOS devices. It utilizes the Hacker News API provided by [hn.algolia.com](https://hn.algolia.com) to fetch the latest articles trending on the platform. The application provides a simple interface where users can view the titles of the Hacker News posts along with the number of upvotes. Tapping on a post opens a web view, allowing users to read the full article.

## Project Goals
- Learn to work with SwiftUI Lists and the Identifiable Protocol.
- Use a Navigation View to navigate between the List and a detail view.
- Implement advanced state management using the Observer Design Pattern.
- Incorporate a UIKit component into SwiftUI by using WebKit to display web pages in the app.

## How to Use
To use the H4X0R app:
1. Clone the git repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in Xcode.
3. Build and run the project on a device running iOS 13 or newer.

## Limitations
The Hacker News API has certain limitations:
- No registration is required, and no API key is needed.
- There's a limit of 10,000 requests from the same IP per hour.
